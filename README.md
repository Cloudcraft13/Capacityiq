# CapacityIQ — Warehouse Capacity Marketplace (Prototype)

CapacityIQ is an early-stage digital platform designed to unlock unused warehouse capacity
and provide flexible, short-term storage solutions for businesses.

This repository contains a front-end prototype built to demonstrate user flows,
platform logic, and the proposed technical direction of the product.

## Problem
- UK warehouses often operate with unused pallet and rack capacity
- SMEs and eCommerce sellers struggle to find flexible, short-term storage
- Existing 3PL solutions are expensive, rigid, and slow to onboard

## Solution
CapacityIQ connects warehouses with available capacity to businesses that need storage,
enabling real-time discovery, booking requests, and capacity optimisation.

## Prototype Features
- Warehouse search by location
- Warehouse detail view with capacity and pricing
- Booking request flow (demo)
- Warehouse owner dashboard to update capacity
- Simulated real-time updates (demo data)

## Technology (Planned)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend (planned): AWS API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB/RDS
- AI/ML (planned): Demand forecasting and capacity optimisation
- Infrastructure: Cloud-native, scalable microservices

## Status
This is a non-production prototype created for endorsement review,
market validation, and stakeholder demonstrations.
